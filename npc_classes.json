At any given time, they are likely to be operating in both the physical battlefield and the tempest of the omninet. To handle the chaotic swirl of inputs and outputs that results from this split perception, Witches often pair with personality-clone NHPs, splitting tasks along parallel tracks to increase combat efficacy.",

Predatory Logic gives them a tool to use against characters with heavy weapons, which can also aid their allies. Targets generally have an opportunity to mitigate their heat somewhat, since Witches deal most of their heat on their next turn."
